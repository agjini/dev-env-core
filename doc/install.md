```

## Credits

This tool is greatly inspired from
- MichaÃ«l Bitard works (tmux conf, bash aliases, ansible base)
- Development environment setup and good practices @ LivingObjects

## Classical manjaro installation steps done after the core install :

### Disable speaker

```bash
sudo rmmod pcspkr
sudo echo blacklist pcspkr >> /etc/modprobe.d/nobeep.conf
```

The second line may not work with the following error:
```bash
-bash: /etc/modprobe.d/nobeep.conf: Permission denied
````
Why ? Because the command behind the redirection '>>' is done as a regular user.
Then you need to execute this instead:
```bash
sudo sh -c "echo 'blacklist pcspkr' >> /etc/modprobe.d/nobeep.conf"
```
OR
```bash
echo 'blacklist pcspkr | sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/nobeep.conf
```
'tee' command is very powerful for this kind of works.
It reads data from stadard input and write to standard output and files.
